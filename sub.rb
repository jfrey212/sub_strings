# Project description:
# Implement a method #substrings that takes a word as the first argument and
# then an array of valid substrings (your dictionary) as the second argument. It
# should return a hash listing each substring (case insensitive) that was found in
#  the original string and how many times it was found.

# word is a string, dictionary is a array of substrings

def sub(word, dictionary)
